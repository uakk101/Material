The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping between the input features and the output labels so that it can make accurate predictions on unseen data."],"metadata":{"id":"z1fN1MTAA9Lt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Example:\n","Consider a dataset of houses with their respective areas and prices. The input features (X) are the areas of the houses, and the output labels (y) are the corresponding prices. By training a supervised learning algorithm on this data, we can predict the price of a new house given its area."],"metadata":{"id":"GAQuTdF3BCim"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Unsupervised Learning:\n","Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with unlabeled data. The algorithm's task is to find patterns or structures within the data without knowing the corresponding output labels.

As a result, it performs poorly on unseen data.\n","\n","Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It performs poorly on both the training and testing data."],"metadata":{"id":"Hc77Pj50BXYl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Example:\n"," Consider a polynomial regression model to fit a few data points. If we use a high-degree polynomial (overfitting), the model might pass through every data point, but it will fail to generalize to new data.
