# Trigonometric functions
math.sin(x)       # sine of x (x is in radians)
math.cos(x)       # cosine of x (x is in radians)
math.tan(x)       # tangent of x (x is in radians)
math.radians(x)   # converts x from degrees to radians
math.degrees(x)   # converts x from radians to degrees
math.exp(x)       # exponential of x (e^x)
math.log(x)       # natural logarithm of x (base e)
math.log10(x)     # logarithm of x to base 10
math.log2(x)      # logarithm of x to base 2
math.pow(x, y)    # x raised to the power y (x^y)
math.sqrt(x)      # square root of x

# Other functions
math.ceil(x)      # rounds x up to the nearest integer
math.floor(x)     # rounds x down to the nearest integer
math.factorial(x) # factorial of x

math.isinf(x)     # checks if x is infinity
math.isnan(x)     # checks if x is NaN (Not a Number)

# Constants
math.pi           # mathematical constant pi (π)
math.e            # mathematical constant e

# Example usage
print(math.sin(math.radians(45)))  # prints the sine of 45 degrees












# The conversion between degrees and radians is as follows:

# To convert from degrees to radians: radians = degrees * (π/180)
# To convert from radians to degrees: degrees = radians * (180/π)
